We are the group that was using stringTokenizer. We were able to use your
code from class as a base and add more to get things running without the
string tokenizer library. Our Lexer currently doesnt not regonize comments
and leave them out and does not put strings in quotes as one token, but rather
saves the quotes as quote tokens and the strings inside as variables. I included
some screen shots of our test Coverage which is pretty good.
